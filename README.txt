Welcome to version 2 of my Python number guessing game! 

I created the original for the Python Tech Degree at Team Treehouse. 
Since then, I have earned my certificate and started their Data Analysis path. 
This program is very similar. The user has to guess a randomly generated number 
between 1 through 100. Their goal is to guess the number in the least
 amount of guesses. 

After the user correctly guesses the number, this program will 
show statistics based on how the user performs. It stores the 
scores inside of a score array, and it displays to the user the 
following: Best Score, Mean, Median, and Mode of their scores. 

Thank you for viewing my project!
